drawlogic actionscript tools and libraries for consumption and improvement.

These tools are utilities, kits and baseplane tools for using existing AS3 and actionscript libraries.  This is a platform on top of the great tools of the flash and silverlight communities. Simplified apis, common usage scenarios, lowering the entry point to usage for many common kits.

Some of the tools that are used include

Animation Kits
  * Tweener
  * TweenLite
  * Go

3d Engines
  * Papervision 3D
  * Away3D
  * Sandy3D

Servers
  * FMS
  * Red5

2D Physics Engines
  * Motor2
  * FOAM
  * Box2DFlashAS3

3D Physics Engines
  * Wow

Utilities
  * BulkLoader
  * AnimatedBitmap

And lots of custom code.

The main goal is to have a small subset of tools that are the current best able to be plugged into the framework to make it common across all of them to make them pluggable for common needs.

Much of this code is part of the bredengine and engines from drawk and bridgeware.com
